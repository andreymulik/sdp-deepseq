# SDP DeepSeq

This is an extension, that provides `NFData` instances for `sdp` structures.

## Reasons

`deepseq` requires `array` package so I can't use it in main library (one
array library mustn't cannot require another array library as a dependency).

## Versioning

`sdp-deepseq` follows of the [Haskell PVP](https://pvp.haskell.org) and `sdp`
extension rules.

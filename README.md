# SDP DeepSeq

This is an extension, that provides NFData instances for SDP structures.

## Reasons

Package deepseq requires array package so i can't use it in main library,
because array library cannot require another array library as a dependency.

## Versioning

sdp-deepseq follows of the [Haskell PVP](https://pvp.haskell.org) and SDP
extension rules.
